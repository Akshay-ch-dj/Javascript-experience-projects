## CONSOLE DEBUGGING IN JAVASCRIPT

```javascript
// To log the item
console.log("");
// To put a warning (yellow) in the console
console.warn("");
// To put an error (RED) in the console.
console.error("");
// To show objects as table in the console.
console.table("");
```

## USING a DEBUGGER IN CHROME

* Go to *sources* and the `script` file
* Add breakpoints to suspicious lines of code (mark wik a red dot when clicked on the line).
* Now the execution will freeze at these time and shows the current status.
* Then using the top buttons, one can execute code one by one and examine it.
* After finishing click on the red dot again to stop the debugging at that line.
* The debugger is really useful for the problems that causing with the loops, set breakpoints at certain positions of points in the loop.
* To call the **debugger right from the code**, use the `debugger;`,then it opens the debugger at this point,

Look in the [script.js](./script.js) for more basic JS operations with comments.
